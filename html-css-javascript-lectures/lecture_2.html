    <!-- href; stands for hypertext reference, is an attribute; an attribute is typically a name value pair that modifies the behavior of an element; this is an absolute URL; but there is also a relative URL, meaning that you can point to things more locally, so you just need a file name for that  -->
     <!-- Target is another attribute; if set to "_blank", it will either open it in a new tab or a new windows depending on browser settings -->
      <!-- title attribute provides additional information about the element -->
