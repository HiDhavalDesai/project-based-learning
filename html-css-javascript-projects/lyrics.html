    <h3>"Crazy in the Moonlight"</h3>
    <hr>
    <p><strong>(Verse 1)</strong></p>
    <p>
    I can't help but feel the magic,<br>
    Every Glace feels like a spark<br>
    With you, it's like a movie,<br>
    We're dancing in the dark.<br>
    Whispers through the night air,<br>
    Secrets wrapped up in your smile, <br>
    You pull me close, and babe, I swear, <br>
    You make my heart race, just for a while. <br>
    
    <p><strong>(Chorus)</strong></p>
    We're crazy in the moonlight,<br>
    Holding on so tight,<br>
    Like stars, we're shining bright,<br>
    Got lost in this love song tonight.<br>
    With every beat, we take our flight,<br>
    In your arms, everything feels right,<br>
    Just you and me, let’s ignite,<br>
    Baby, we’re crazy in the moonlight.
    
    <p><strong>(Verse 2)</strong></p>
    Your laughter's like a melody,<br>
    It echoes through my soul,<br>
    In this crazy life, we’re wild and free,<br>
    You make me feel whole.<br>
    We’ll paint the world in colors,<br>
    That only we can see,<br>
    With every kiss, we discover,<br>
    Just how beautiful we can be.

    <p><strong>(Chorus)</strong></p>
    We're crazy in the moonlight,<br>
    Holding on so tight,<br>
    Like stars, we're shining bright,<br>
    Got lost in this love song tonight.<br>
    With every beat, we take our flight,<br>
    In your arms, everything feels right,<br>
    Just you and me, let’s ignite,<br>
    Baby, we’re crazy in the moonlight.

    <p><strong>(Bridge)</strong></p>
    And if the world tries to tear us apart,<br>
    We’ll rise from the ashes, unbreakable hearts,<br>
    Screaming our love into the night sky,<br>
    With you by my side, we’ll learn how to fly.<br>

    <p><strong>(Chorus)</strong></p>
    We're crazy in the moonlight,<br>
    Holding on so tight,<br>
    Like stars, we're shining bright,<br>
    Got lost in this love song tonight.<br>
    With every beat, we take our flight,<br>
    In your arms, everything feels right,<br>
    Just you and me, let’s ignite,<br>
    Baby, we’re crazy in the moonlight.

    <p><strong>(Outro)</strong></p>
    So let’s keep this fire burning,<br>
    As we dance under the stars,<br>
    Forever in this moment,<br>
    No matter where we are.<br>
    Crazy in the moonlight,<br>
    You and me, we’ll make it through,<br>
    This love song crazy,<br>
    Is written just for you.
